# Using one framework to make two different games
I tried to make Space Invaders &amp; Freeze Monster (a simple "freeze the monsters" and win game) using the same framework, which was initially given to me by my object oriented programming professor.
I did alter it quite a bit and tried to make it as clean as possible.
